        Its like saving progress, i.e. if you visit this spot on say google maps and you register it as seen, store that in local memory 
            Idea for implemen:
                Save current page into memory, could be easy and painless page meaning the internal page not the page url itself as that would not need to be saved, also include an encrypted login state?
                Save visited items? i.e. have a tick if you have clicked its description?
