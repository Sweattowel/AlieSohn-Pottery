Feedback TODO List:

COMPLETE Implement Responsive Design: Optimize design for various screen sizes and devices.
UNCOMPLETE Retain State After Component Unmount: Explore using LocalStorage, Cookies, or unique user ID-based cookie storage to retain state after users leave the webpage.
    Addit: 
        Its like saving progress, i.e. if you visit this spot on say google maps and you register it as seen, store that in local memory 
            Idea for implemen:
                Save current page into memory, could be easy and painless page meaning the internal page not the page url itself as that would not need to be saved, also include an encrypted login state?
COMPLETE Implement Route Protection: Use JWT or session-based authentication for protecting routes on the backend.
    Addit: 
        More research into how i did it and whether it is secure or not is required 
UNCOMPLETE Check Database Connection Limits: Investigate if the database has a maximum amount of concurrent connections and consider implementing a connection pool if necessary.
COMPLETE Ensure API Security: Validate request bodies to prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
COMPLETE Consider Learning C# or Golang: Expand development skills by exploring languages like C# or Golang, commonly used in the industry.
    Addit: 
        Maybe rewrite server code to use C# or Golang? potential option
COMPLETE Explore UI Enhancement: Experiment with color theory, UI beautification using tools like React Spring, and ensuring consistency in font sizes and weights.
COMPLETE Optimize Frontend Code: Continuously strive for clean and efficient frontend code.
COMPLETE Optional: Further UI Development: If interested, delve deeper into UI development, considering resources like AWS for full-stack solutions.
COMPLETE Explore Color Theory: Learn about the 60-30-10 rule for color coordination and proper color selection.
COMPLETE Enhance UI Beautification: Experiment with hover effects, box shadows, and other visual enhancements using libraries like React Spring.
    Addit: 
        Added box shadows for storeItem cards, looks nice so far, too much?
COMPLETE Maintain Consistency in Design: Ensure consistency in font sizes, weights, and other attributes for a polished UI.
COMPLETE Continue Learning and Experimenting: Keep exploring and experimenting with UI development to improve skills and knowledge in the area.
COMPLETE Refurbish JWT to use cookies or an interceptor which will update the token silently when it is near expirery 
COMPLETE port server to C# as recommended/suggested by Chris
